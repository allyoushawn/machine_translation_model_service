# ML Model Service
We treat each ml model service as a microservice, and we are using fastAPI for microservice deployment.
This repository could serve as multiple standalone services or be used as 
one of the backend ml service for ml service gateway ([repo](https://github.com/allyoushawn/mlservice)).

To run each ml model service, refer to the README in each service.
